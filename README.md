# Missing .uproject file

Something went wrong while I was working on the project and now for some reason my .uproject file is missing. I was able to work on everything just fine but once I closed the project and tried to re-open it I was unable to since my .uproject file had disappeared from my local. After checking Github, I realized that the file was never committed either. I honestly don't know what happened and I'm trying to figure out how I can restore the project but nothing is working :/

# Update 2/14:
Got help from Rushill's office hours, managed to restore the project on my local. All files should be pushed to Github now, although if anything was missed please let me know and I'll look into it
