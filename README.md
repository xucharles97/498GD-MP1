# Missing .uproject file

Something went wrong while I was working on the project and now for some reason my .uproject file is missing. I was able to work on everything just fine but once I closed the project and tried to re-open it I was unable to since my .uproject file had disappeared from my local. After checking Github, I realized that the file was never committed either. I honestly don't know what happened and I'm trying to figure out how I can restore the project but nothing is working :/
